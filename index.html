          <h4 class="test-head">Life-changing treatment</h4>
          <p class="testi">One of the best things I have ever done. I never thought my teeth would look this good, my confidence has grown and I no longer feel people are looking at my teeth. It's not just orthodontics, it is life-changing. Deena and her team are fantastic, they make you feel so comfortable. Could not be more happy and would recommend CLEARLY Ngong Haven Clinic. Thank you for everything.<br>~ MISS L Eileen 29.</p>
          <h4 class="test-head">A new smile</h4>
          <p class="testi">Thank you so much for my 'new' teeth, they are amazing. Not only have I got a new smile, but it has built my confidence so much. The actual steps before getting my results were so relaxed and you always seemed to calm me down and make me feel welcome. I will never be able to thank you enough for what you have done. I will recommend you to anyone who wants braces. Thank you again <br> Ms J. Wairimu. </p>
          <h4 class="test-head">Great recommendation</h4>
          <p class="testi">I am so pleased with the orthodontic treatment I have received here. I could never have imagined how different my teeth would look and with such a simple procedure! I would highly recommend Invisalign to anyone - it will change your life! Thank you so much to Deena and the team at CLEARLY Ngong Haven Clinic. They made the whole experience so simple. <br> ~ Mr. J Wambugu. </p>
